# MovieLens

## Overview

The MovieLens dataset provides insights into user ratings and tagging activities from MovieLens, a movie recommendation service. It includes 100,836 ratings and 3,683 tag applications across 9,742 movies, generated by 610 users between March 29, 1996, and September 24, 2018. This dataset was last updated on September 26, 2018.

Users were randomly selected for inclusion, having rated at least 20 movies. No demographic information is provided, with each user represented solely by an ID.

The dataset comprises four files: `links.csv`, `movies.csv`, `ratings.csv`, and `tags.csv`, each offering specific insights into movie ratings, tags, and metadata.

## Content and Use of Files

### Formatting and Encoding

The dataset files are encoded in UTF-8 and written in comma-separated values (CSV) format with a single header row. Columns containing commas are escaped using double quotes.

### User IDs

User IDs are anonymized and consistent across `ratings.csv` and `tags.csv`.

### Movie IDs

Only movies with at least one rating or tag are included, and movie IDs are consistent across the dataset files.

### Ratings Data File Structure (`ratings.csv`)

Each line represents one rating of one movie by one user, with the format: `userId,movieId,rating,timestamp`.

Ratings are on a 5-star scale, with timestamps in seconds since January 1, 1970 (UTC).

### Tags Data File Structure (`tags.csv`)

Each line represents one tag applied to one movie by one user, with the format: `userId,movieId,tag,timestamp`.

Tags are user-generated metadata, with timestamps in seconds since January 1, 1970 (UTC).

### Movies Data File Structure (`movies.csv`)

Each line represents one movie, with the format: `movieId,title,genres`.

Movie titles include release years in parentheses, and genres are pipe-separated.

### Links Data File Structure (`links.csv`)

Each line represents one movie, with the format: `movieId,imdbId,tmdbId`.

Movie IDs link to MovieLens, IMDb, and TMDb.

## Cross-Validation

Prior versions included pre-computed cross-folds or scripts for cross-fold computation, but these are not included in the current dataset. Users interested in cross-validation for recommender systems can refer to [LensKit](http://lenskit.org) for tools, documentation, and code examples.
